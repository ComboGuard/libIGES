Known bugs:

Sep 26 2015:

    1. MSBO and related entities:
        The MSBO object is buggy; although models are largely preserved and rendered as
        expected, some features are damaged and in FreeCAD they can be seen as points
        scattered in space. The logic must be checked to ensure a faithful copy of the
        data.
