{"name":"libIGES","tagline":"Implementation of the IGESv5.3 specification","body":"### Welcome to the libIGES project\r\nThis project aims to create a C++ library for preprocessing\r\nand creating IGESv5.3 solid model data interchange files.\r\nAs of July 2015 the library has enough features implemented\r\nthat it can merge existing IGES models into a single assembly\r\nfile and can be used to create a solid model of electronic\r\ncircuit boards.\r\n\r\nThe libIGES library aims to be a lightweight implementation\r\nfor extracting, writing, and viewing model data; it is not\r\nintended as the core of a Mechanical CAD application.\r\n\r\nThe current code features support for the following IGES\r\nentities:\r\n\r\n* 100: Circular Arc\r\n* 102: Composite Curve\r\n* 104: Conic Arc\r\n* 110: Line\r\n* 120: Surface of Revolution\r\n* 122: Tabulated Cylinder\r\n* 124: Transformation Matrix\r\n* 126: Rational B-Spline Curve\r\n* 128: Rational B-Spline Surface\r\n* 142: Curve on a Parametric Surface\r\n* 144: Trimmed Parametric Surface\r\n* 154: Right Circular Cylinder\r\n* 164: Solid of Linear Extrusion\r\n* 180: Boolean Tree\r\n* 186: Manifold Solid BREP Object (MSBO)\r\n* 308: Subfigure Definition\r\n* 314: Color Definition\r\n* 408: Singular Subfigure Instance\r\n* 502: Vertex\r\n* 504: Edge\r\n* 508: Loop\r\n* 510: Face\r\n* 514: Shell (Form 1 only)\r\n\r\nA number of programs exist primarily for the purpose\r\nof testing and validating the IGES preprocessor; of\r\nthese programs the following two may be of general\r\nuse:\r\n\r\n* mergetest: takes an input file with a list of\r\n  IGES model files and associated position and\r\n  orientation data and creates an IGES assembly\r\n  file.\r\n* idf2igs: takes an IDFv2 or IDFv3 interchange file\r\n  set (*.emn and *.emp files) and creates an IGES\r\n  assembly representing the electronic circuit board\r\n  as described by the IDF files. This tool may be\r\n  useful to Mechanical CAD users who need to work\r\n  with IDF files but who have no IDF translator.\r\n\r\nAs of July 2015 the library does not yet have any\r\ncapability to create a graphical representation of\r\nthe model data for visual display.\r\n\r\nThe library is portable between operating systems\r\nand instructions are included for building in a\r\nLinux environment and in an MS Windows environment\r\nusing either the MicroSoft Visual Studio tools or\r\nthe GNU compiler collection provided with MinGW.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
