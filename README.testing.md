These are instructions for those who would like to build
libIGES and help test the current implementation. Various
MCAD packages have their own schemes for implementing IGES
models and each has its own quirks. For libIGES to become
a robust IGES preprocessor it must be tested against as
many IGES models generated by as many MCAD packages as
possible. The following instructions describe how to build
the current implementation and how to use the supplied
test programs 'readtest' and 'mergetest' to read and
write IGES files and how to help contribute to the
improvement of libIGES.

I. Building libIGES and the test programs
    a. Dependencies
        + cmake
        + make
        + libboost (boost_filesystem  and boost_system)
        + C++ compiler (preferably gcc 4.9 or later)

    b. Building:
        + change to the source directory:
            cd src
        + create a 'build' directory and change to that:
            mkdir build && cd build
        + configure with cmake:
            cmake ..
        + compile with make:
            make

II. Test program: readtest
    The program 'readtest' will read the file specified on
    the command line and write it back out to the file
    'test_out_read.igs'. If the program succeeds then the
    output file must contain all the data contained in the
    original file. Look out for messages about entities
    culled; ideally this should be '0' - if not then there
    may be a bug in the library or else the entity is not
    yet supported. Please post on the issue tracker and
    include the IGES file which failed to read and write
    correctly.  A second test is to load the output file
    into FreeCAD; it should display exactly as the original
    file if everything is fine.

    Example usage:
    ./readtest my_model.igs

III. Test program: mergetest
    The program 'mergetest' takes an input file which
    contains a list of IGES model files each with a
    list of position parameters. One instance of the
    model is created for every set of position parameters
    provided. Input files may be part files or assemblies;
    the output file will be an IGES assembly file named
    'test_out_merge.igs' which should respect the structure
    of all contained assemblies and subassemblies. The output
    may be rendered with FreeCAD; if it does not render
    correctly please post an issue and provide the input
    control file and IGES files used.

    Input control file format:
    file: "model_filename.igs"
    pos: zRotation, flip (0/1), xOffset, yOffset, zOffset;
    [other 'pos:' lines to create more instances of the model]
    [more sets of 'file:' and 'pos:' lines]

    The position parameters:
    + zRotation: rotation of the component about its vertical axis
    + flip: 0: item will be positioned on the (imaginary) TOP surface
            1: item will be positioned on the BOTTOM surface (flipped
            180 degrees along the X axis)
    + xOffset, yOffset, zOffset: translation of the part. Note that
      X and Y offsets are absolute while the zOffset is negated when
      'flip' is 1.

    Input control file example:
    file: "block-and_peg.IGS"
    pos: 0,0,0,0,0;
    file: "block_hole.IGS"
    pos: -45,0,0,0,15;
    file: "peg.IGS"
    pos: 0,0,15,15,1.6;
    file: "6371.igs"
    pos: 0,0,30,30,1.6;
    pos: 90,1,30,30,0;

    Example usage:
    ./mergetest my_assembly

    Note: IGES models may be in any of 3 orientations
    (vertical axis of the physical model along X, Y, or Z);
    this is due primarily to different users choosing different
    planes of reference when models are created. The 'mergetest'
    program will eventually contain extra parameters to reorient
    the model before appying the position controls but at the
    moment that functionality is not yet coded so don't be
    surprised if your assembly doesn't quite look the way
    you expected it to.
