1. Implement some entity dependency code; see p.69 of IGES spec.
For example, every entity added to a Composite Curve should
have a Physical Dependency. In turn any Composite Curve
acting as a Curve on Surface is dependent on that
Curve on Surface (E142).

2. In future if someone wants to render curves etc, it makes
   little sense to let the user implement the interpolations.
   Implement interpolation routines which return an entire
   point set for each curve or surface and let the specific
   IGES entity calculate the point set based on an error
   parameter specified by the user (default: IGES minResolution).

3. Surface of Revolution:
    + ensure Axis is a LINE entity

4. [FIXED] [URGENT] Bug in IGES_POINT; 'p0 = p1 - p2' returns the wrong result

5. To load Molex model 473460001.igs support is required for entities:
    + Type 104: Conic Arc
    + Type 186: Manifold Solid B-REP
    + Type 502: Vertex List
    + Type 504: Edge List
    + Type 508: Loop
    + Type 510: Face
    + Type 514: Shell
