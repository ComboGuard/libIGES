This software is being developed on a Debian Linux system
and the CMake scripts have not been tested on other
systems, so developers and testers using other systems
will have to sort out issues on their own at the moment.
Installation instructions below assume a Debian-based
system; users of other systems will have to modify the
instructions to suit their own package managers.

I. Requirements:
a. git:
    apt-get install git

b. BOOST system and filesystem:
    apt-get install libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev

c. cmake:
    apt-get install cmake

d. GCC (gcc, g++, GNU make) and other build tools:
    apt-get install build-essential


II. Cloning with git:
    git clone https://github.com/cbernardo/libIGES.git

III. Cloning the SINTEF SISL libraries:
    cd libIGES
    git submodule init
    git submodule update


IV. Build: create a build directory and run cmake then make:
    cd src
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    (alt: "make -j 8" or similar to use multiple cores to compile)

That's all; there is no INSTALL script at this point since
the software is still under development.

Most of the test programs will be in the 'build' directory
except for the 'idf2igs' tool which will be in the 'build/idf'
directory. To run the idf2igs tool:

./idf2igs -f some_IDF_file.emn

The resulting IGES file can be viewed in your favorite
MCAD software. SolidWorks will display the assembly
with colors while FreeCAD uses only grey.
